Secure Student Management System
Description: An internal web system for managing students, courses, and grades. Initially developed with common vulnerabilities, it will be hardened to meet enterprise security standards.
User Roles:
Admin: Full control over students, courses, and grades.
Lecturer: Can only add/edit marks for students enrolled in their assigned courses.
Student: Can only view their own records and grades.
Phase 1: The Insecure Baseline Application
This phase focuses on getting the functionality working without proper security controls. This creates the "before" picture for your project.
